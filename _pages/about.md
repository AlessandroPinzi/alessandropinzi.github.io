Currently, I am a Ph.D. student in Statistics and Computer Science at University Luigi Bocconi. My reasearch interests are on mathematical analysis, in particular in optimal transport and geometric analysis.

If you need more informations, feel free to contact me by email: [alessandro.pinzi@phd.unibocconi.it](mailto:alessandro.pinzi@phd.unibocconi.it).
