I am a Master student in Data Science at the University of Pisa and a Honors student in Economics at Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies.

**UPDATE [06/27]:** Our paper on the analysis of venture capital investments with tools from network science and functional data analysis has been published on Applied Network Science. [Check it out!](https://doi.org/10.1007/s41109-022-00482-y)

**UPDATE:** On September 2022, I will join Bocconi University, Milan, as a PhD student in Statistics and Computer Science!
