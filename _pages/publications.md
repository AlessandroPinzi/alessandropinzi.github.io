In contemporary science, I find statistics to be an essential tool to understand phenomena, and to draw reliable conclusions. I am broadly interested in the analysis of complex and large data, with particular emphasis on structured objects such as functional data and networks. I am also involved in projects at the intersection of computer science, optimization and statistical machine learning, where computational feasibility and inferential stability play a crucial role. Currently, I am working on the following research projects:

- Functional Feature Selection
- [The Climate Repository Project](https://github.com/testalorenzo/climate_repository 'climate')
- COVID-19 Project, whose results appeared in the news [[1]](https://www.psu.edu/news/research/story/staying-home-primary-care-and-limiting-contagion-hubs-may-curb-covid-19-deaths/), [[2, Italian]](https://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/covid-italia-statistica-che-analizza-prima-ondata-perche-tassi-mortalita-tanto-diversi-le-regioni-AEfHQmf), [[3, Italian]](https://www.santannapisa.it/it/news/covid-19-italia-la-statistica-fa-luce-sul-perche-la-prima-ondata-abbia-causato-tassi-di) and as a [Scipod's podcast](https://www.scipod.global/dr-marzia-cremona-using-functional-data-analysis-to-better-understand-covid-19-mortality/)

You can find my publication list in my [CV](https://testalorenzo.github.io/files/CV_updated_May22.pdf "LT_CV") and on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gDmLTJQAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=2 "Google_Scholar") profile.
