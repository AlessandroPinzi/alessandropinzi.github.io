In contemporary science, I find statistics to be an essential tool to understand phenomena, and to draw reliable conclusions. I am broadly interested in the analysis of complex and large data, with particular emphasis on structured objects such as functional data and networks. I am also involved in projects at the intersection of computer science, optimization and statistical machine learning, where computational feasibility and inferential stability play a crucial role. Currently, I am working on the following research projects:

- Functional Feature Selection
- [The Climate Repository Project](https://github.com/testalorenzo/climate_repository 'climate')
- COVID-19 Project

You can find my publication list in my [CV](https://testalorenzo.github.io/files/CV_updated_May22.pdf "LT_CV") and on my[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gDmLTJQAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=2 "Google_Scholar") profile.
